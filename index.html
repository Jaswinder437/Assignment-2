      <p>
        The club isn't the best place to find a lover
        So the bar is where I go
        Me and my friends at the table doing shots
        Drinking fast and then we talk slow
      </p>
      <p>
        You come and start up a conversation with just me
        And trust me I'll give it a chance now
        Take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox
        And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
      </p>
      <p>
        Girl, you know I want your love
        Your love was handmade for somebody like me
        Come on now, follow my lead
        I may be crazy, don't mind me
      </p>
      <p>
        Say, boy, let's not talk too much
        Grab on my waist and put that body on me
        Come on now, follow my lead
        Come, come on now, follow my lead
      </p>
